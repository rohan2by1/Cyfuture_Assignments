## Project Overview

This repository showcases a collection of Python-based projects developed as part of Cyfuture assignments. Each assignment focuses on a different aspect of AI and machine learning.

The following assignments are included:

*   **1-AI\_recipe\_generator:**  AI-powered recipe generation.
*   **2-face\_rec:** Face recognition implementation.
*   **3-text\_to\_image:** Text-to-image generation.
*   **4-Neural\_style\_transfer:** Neural style transfer techniques.
*   **5-emotion\_detection:** Emotion detection from text or images.
*   **6-stt\_whisper:** Speech-to-text conversion using Whisper.
*   **7-plagiarism\_checker\_ai:** AI-based plagiarism checker.

## Installation Instructions üõ†Ô∏è

To run these projects, you'll need Python installed on your system.  It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/rohan2by1/Cyfuture_Assignments.git
    cd Cyfuture_Assignments
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**

    Each project likely has its own set of dependencies. Navigate to the directory of the specific assignment you want to run and install the required packages.  Look for a `requirements.txt` file in each assignment directory.

    ```bash
    cd 1-AI_recipe_generator  # Example: Navigate to the recipe generator directory
    pip install -r requirements.txt  # If a requirements.txt file exists
    ```

    If a `requirements.txt` file doesn't exist, you'll need to examine the project's code to determine the necessary packages and install them individually using `pip install <package_name>`.

## Key Features ‚ú®

Each assignment demonstrates a specific AI/ML capability:

*   **AI Recipe Generator:** Generates recipes based on provided ingredients or dietary restrictions.
*   **Face Recognition:** Identifies faces in images or videos.
*   **Text-to-Image:** Creates images from textual descriptions.
*   **Neural Style Transfer:** Applies the style of one image to another.
*   **Emotion Detection:** Detects emotions from text or visual data.
*   **Speech-to-Text (Whisper):** Transcribes audio into text using the Whisper model.
*   **Plagiarism Checker:** Identifies potential plagiarism in text documents.

## Contribution Guidelines ü§ù

Contributions are welcome! If you find any issues or have suggestions for improvements, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

1.  Fork the repository.
2.  Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix.
3.  Make your changes and commit them with descriptive messages.
4.  Submit a pull request.

## Troubleshooting üêõ

*   **Missing Dependencies:** Ensure all required packages are installed using `pip install -r requirements.txt` (if available) or by manually installing the necessary packages.
*   **Environment Issues:**  Using a virtual environment helps isolate project dependencies and avoid conflicts.
*   **Model Download Errors:** Some projects may require downloading pre-trained models.  Check the project's specific instructions for details on how to download and configure these models.
*   **API Keys:** Some projects may require API keys for services like OpenAI. Make sure to set the appropriate environment variables or configuration settings with your API keys.
